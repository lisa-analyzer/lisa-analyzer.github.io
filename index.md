## Frontends and Projects

LiSA is a powerful engine backing several static analyzers for different
programming languages and domains, all developed as part of the project.
Here are some of the main frontends and projects built on top of LiSA:

<div class="card-row">
  {% include proj_card.html 
    title="JLiSA" 
    content="A frontend for the analysis of Java programs,
    participating in SV-COMP since 2026."
    btn_link="https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/jlisa" 
    btn_text="<i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub" %}
  {% include proj_card.html 
    title="GoLiSA" 
    content="A frontend for the analysis of Go blockchain programs and
    smart contracts, focusing on Hyperledger Fabric, Cosmos SDK,
    Tendermint Core, and Ethereum Client."
    btn_link="https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/go-lisa" 
    btn_text="<i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub" %}
  {% include proj_card.html 
    title="EVMLiSA" 
    content="A frontend for sound CFG reconstruction and analysis of EVM bytecode for Ethereum blockchains."
    btn_link="https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/evm-lisa" 
    btn_text="<i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub" %}
</div>

See all available frontends and projects in the [Configuration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/configuration/#frontends).

## Get Involved

LiSA is developed and maintained by the [Software and System Verification
(SSV)]({{ site.ssv-homepage }}) group @ Università Ca' Foscari in Venice,
Italy. External contributions are always welcome! Check out our [contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/lisa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for information on how to contribute to LiSA.

We are open for collaborations! If you want to work with LiSA or have an idea
for a new frontend and you want to join forces, get in contact with one of the team members.

## People

LiSA is the result of the work of many people gravitating around the
[SSV research group]({{ site.ssv-homepage }}), focusing on different parts
of the library or on one of the frontends developed over the years.
